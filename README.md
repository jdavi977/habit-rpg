**Project Overview**

HabitRPG is a gamified self-improvement platform designed to help users build and track habits, complete tasks, and grow through an RPG-style system. The project blends task management, reward systems, and RPG progression to motivate consistent personal growth.



**Core Features**

- **Task Management**: Users can create daily, weekly, and custom tasks.
- **Rollover System**: Daily reset at user-defined times, handled timezone-aware.
- **Streaks & Rewards**: Completing tasks increases streaks, gold, XP, and multipliers.
- **Leveling System**: Users gain XP to level up; XP scales with difficulty and streaks.
- **Stats & Inventory**: Users track stats like gold, mana, level, and earned rewards.
- **AI-Driven Classes & Skills System** (planned): Users unlock skills and classes based on habits, powered by AI recommendations.
- **User Collaboration **(planned) - Users can form parties and join guilds to track progress together, encourage accountability, and complete group challenges.
- **Boss Battles** (planned) - Parties can challenge powerful "bosses" where each member's skills and passives contribute to the fight. Success requires teamwork and consistent habit completion, and victory unlocks unique rewards.


**Technical Stack**

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TailwindCSS, ShadCN/UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres DB, Auth, API), Convex (planned for AI interactions)
- **Auth**: Clerk for authentication
- **Timezone Handling**: Luxon/Temporal for safe timezone conversions
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Docker for dev environment


**Real-World Problem Solved**

This project addresses the problem of **habit consistency and personal growth**. Many people struggle with motivation to maintain daily habits. By turning habit-building into a role-playing game, the app makes personal development engaging, rewarding, and trackable.
